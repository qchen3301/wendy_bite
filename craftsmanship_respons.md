As of being enrolled in this cohort I am somewhere at the high end of apprentice. At the end I would like to be near the gateway of practitioner. After graduation I will make it a goal to be a practitioner, and at the end of five years a master. I doubt I will ever reach stage seven, and although I'm open to the possibility, I can't see myself ever being interested in a particular language or problem (in computer science) to devote that much of my time and energy to being that "extra," as the youth culture says.
